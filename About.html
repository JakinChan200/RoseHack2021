    <p>
      Our mission is to provide women with the resources for emergency long-term
      house-assistance or emergency medical assistance. 1 in 4 woman experience
      domestic violence and 38% of these victims become homeless. Shelters have
      the capabilities to provide protection and support services. They can also
      contribute to social change to prevent violence in the future. Survivors
      of violence often do not report it and assisting them with location where
      they can recieve help can ensure them they are safe and protected.
